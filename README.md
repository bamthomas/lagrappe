(Former) Web site source of lagrappe.net

The source code has moved on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/bamthomas/lagrappe).

This movement is mainly because I don't trust Microsoft for hosting source code (cf issues with [open source license infrigement](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/)). I don't want neither to feed [AI LLM for copilot](https://slides.com/tristancoignion/green-my-llm-interne/).
